Of course. Here are a few ways to rephrase that section to be more specific, as you requested.

### **Recommended Option**

This version is clear, direct, and tells the user exactly which variable to change and in which file.

"**Set the Agent Count:** In the code, both the start and goal positions for each agent are generated randomly on valid map nodes. To run a simulation, you only need to adjust the `number_of_agents_to_create` variable in the `CBS_Main.py` file."

-----

### **Alternative Phrasings**

  * **More concise:** "Agent start and goal positions are randomized automatically. Simply set the `number_of_agents_to_create` value in `CBS_Main.py` to get started."
  * **More instructional:** "To configure the number of agents, open `CBS_Main.py` and modify the `number_of_agents_to_create` variable. The script will automatically assign random start and goal positions for each agent."

### **Updated Full README Example**

Hereâ€™s how the recommended option looks inside the complete README we've been building.

**Project Title: CBS Algorithm for MAPF**

This repository contains an implementation of the **Conflict-Based Search (CBS)** algorithm, a leading method for efficiently solving the **Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)** problem. The goal is to find optimal, collision-free paths for multiple agents from their starting locations to their respective destinations in a shared environment.

This project explores the core components of CBS, including the low-level search for individual agent paths and the high-level search that resolves conflicts between them. We aim to provide a clear and well-documented implementation for educational and research purposes.

### **Getting Started / Usage**

You can easily test the CBS implementation with your own scenarios.

1.  **Customize the Map:** Create or modify a map file that fits your needs.
2.  **Set the Agent Count:** In the code, both the start and goal positions for each agent are generated randomly on valid map nodes. To run a simulation, you only need to adjust the `number_of_agents_to_create` variable in the `CBS_Main.py` file.
3.  **Run the Simulation:** Execute the main script from your terminal.
