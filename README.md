Project Title: CBS Algorithm for MAPF

This repository contains an implementation of the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm, a leading method for efficiently solving the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem. The goal is to find optimal, collision-free paths for multiple agents from their starting locations to their respective destinations in a shared environment.

This project explores the core components of CBS, including the low-level search for individual agent paths and the high-level search that resolves conflicts between them. We aim to provide a clear and well-documented implementation for educational and research purposes.
